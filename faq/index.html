            <a>Why are my periods irregular and is this normal?</a>
            <div class="content">
              <p>The average menstrual cycle or gap between the periods is 28 to 30 days, but different women have different cycles, and this is perfectly normal. Things that affect your lifestyle such as stress, illness, weight (gain or loss) and exercise can all affect the cycle, as can hormonal contraception.</p>

            <a>My periods are very heavy with clots. Is this anything to worry about?</a>
            <div class="content">
              <p>Most womens periods last between two and seven days. Generally this includes one or two days of heavy flow.

              However we are all different and therefore this will not be the same for everyone. Also, the amount of bleeding can vary from month to month, and this is totally normal. The bleeding will often have clots.</p>

            <div class="content">

            <a>What causes BV (Bacterial Vaginosis)?</a>
            <div class="content">
              <p>The exact cause of the Bacterial Vaginosis (BV) is not known. However, it is certain that it is not caused by a single germ. It is caused by the overgrowth of various bacteria produced in the vagina. Usually, a number of harmless germs reside in balance inside the vagina to protect it. BV seems to occur when this balance is disturbed.</p>

            <a>What are Fibroids?</a>
            <div class="content">
              <p>Fibroids grow in your womb. They are usually a non-cancerous tumor. They are sometimes called uterine myomas, fibromyomas or leiomyomas. One in every three women gets them, and about half of them are not aware that they have fibroids.</p>

            <a>How do I minimise menopausal symptoms when coming off long-term HRT?</a>
            <div class="content">
              <p>The best chance of avoiding or minimising menopausal symptoms when wanting to come off long-term HRT is to gradually reduce the dose. Change the dose at 3 to 4 weekly intervals, working down to the lowest available dose of tablet or patch. After getting onto the lowest dose, halve the tablets or patches and then stop after another 3 to 4 weeks. This works for most women, but a few will get a return of bad symptoms and may always have difficulty in trying to come off HRT.</p>
